 - minor whitespace fixups.
   The reporter supplied a patch, but it was excessive.

 - use snprintf() when available.

 - fix a sign-extension -> size_t conversion issue when scanning for
   RIFF blocks, which is used to detect if an image uses lossless
   compression.  Due to the way this works I expect it can't be
   triggered, and can't be a security issue.

 - significantly extend the options available for compression.
   I now use the advanced encoding API.
